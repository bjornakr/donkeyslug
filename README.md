DONKEYSLUG
==========
*Donkeylube Software Studios*

Donkeyslug should be some kind of a rougelike game, a dungeon creeper. The player should die easily, and death is permanent,
but I would like some kind of "leftovers" from previous characters, making the game easier over time. The world
should be autogenerated, maybe with additional support for static, hand-made levels. It should stay the same between
characters, though, making new and more "permabuffed" characters able to reach deeper into the levels. I would also like
to make some kind of garden or something that the player could tend to - maybe a place to grow herbs for potions...

What I am really trying to do is to get into Test Driven Development, and apply my freshly accumulated knowledge
procured from the various literature I've been reading. :)
