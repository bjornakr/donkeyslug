Individual creatures of same type should vary in:
- Level
- Strength (normal curve)
- Dexterity
- Items carried










Dunjeon jeneration

Make base roomsize a % of total grid size. Roomsize should vary within a normal distribution w/ high variance.

1. Fill grid with walls
2. Make a random # of rooms
3. Make 



norm dist w/ high var


zapp(initial)
if (rand < 0.25 && zapp < 0) return zapp(initial-1);
else if (rand >= 0.75 && zapp > 0) return zapp(initial+1);
else return initial;


How about item distribution?

Potential algorithm:
1. For all squares, determine item drop by global random drop ratio.
2. Create a randomized ring buffer of every droppable item.
3. For every item, compare a random R (0-1) against the items chance of drop (COD).
4. If R is lower or equal to the item's COD, put the item in the square, and repeat from 1.
5. If not, repeat from 3

NO! I don't like that. If there are two available swords and 40 000 herbs, the chance of a sword drop is minuscule.
Do we need to introduce a "commonness" variable?
sword drop: RARE
armor drop: RARE
herb drop: COMMON

Then we need to define item types as well... Bollocks... Well, we have one already.
interface or abstract class: Item
* Equippable
  - Weapon
  - Armor (apparel?)
* Consumable
  - Herbs and mushrooms - can be combined with other herbs to make potions
  - Potion - combine potions?
* Money? Do we need money? That means vendors.. *sigh*
* Useless items? Why?
* Quest items. Orbs and Amulets and Whatever
 

On items.

Equipables.
Weapons can be equipped, but only one at the time.
Several pieces of apparel and armor can be equipped at the same time, but only once per body part. There are hats/helmets,
chest armor, leggings, boots, gloves and amulets. One can equip two rings.
